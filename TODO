1. expand struct test - for bit_fields and unions - done (except ut for bit_offset and data_member_location in case of bit fields - difficult to create universal test. btw - need a function)
2. expand API for subprograms - need to get params.
3. expand subprograms API UT
4. expand API for arrays (to get offset of Nth element) - done
5. make some highlevel API to get global offset(including bif fields)/type/size e.g. of field in struct in union in array (with C-syntax)
6. modify metac.awk give API to find type by some params.
7. expand API for enums
8. add UT for enums
9. add UT for arrays - done (except arrays without bounds)
10. expand metac_type.h by metac_type_array.h metac_type_union.h metac_type_struct.h metac_type_enum.h metac_type_subprogram.h
