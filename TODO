29. expand UT
    rename metac_type_ut_001.c - it's a set of smoke tests.
    add test for flexible array use-case

30. include errorno.h to metac_type and return normal error code

31.json - need a solution for bit_fields in structs. need to understand how to set this

32. allow void* to be (de)serialized like int??? - not sure that it's a good idea


27. Flexible Array: _metac_alloc_and_fill_recursevly - modify implementation to check if type has array with zero length and has
    siblings with <array_name>_len that sets dynamically length of array. need to show situation when flexible array isn't located at the end. it's a potential error
    
28. _metac_object_delete (_metac_delete): for DW_TAG_union_type check if union has sibling <union_name>_subtype, that says what element of union 
    should be considered as actual. Use the same pattern when serializing/de-serializing data.

11. create function to read/write bit fields (arch independent). See STRUCT_TYPE_SMOKE_MEMBER_BIT_FIELD for more details
5. make some highlevel API to get global offset(including bif fields)/type/size e.g. of field in struct in union in array (with C-syntax)
10. minor - expand metac_type.h by metac_type_array.h metac_type_union.h metac_type_struct.h metac_type_enum.h metac_type_subprogram.h
20. Easy PoC serialization/de-serialization. e.g. to serialize function call params to json (based on the function arguments) and de-serialize them
21. What to do with pointers and cycles?
22. improve serialization by adding different types of data format: json, xml?, asn.1(what sub-types - depends on lib to use), xdr(rpc), xml-rpc/json-rpc????, rest?????
23. try to make serialization/deserialization possible to compile, like regexp can be compiled to improve performance
24. use libffi to construct calls based on serialized data (need to somehow include this into 20/22).

Documentation
26. make doxygen doc generation
