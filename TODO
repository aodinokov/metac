29. expand UT
    rename metac_type_ut_001.c - it's a set of smoke tests.

30. include errorno.h to metac_type and return normal error code

31. to limit the recursion - instead of calling _metac_alloc_and_fill_recursevly in recursion, put adding to queue in _metac_fill_pointer_type

32. BASIC_TYPE_JSON_DES11N_NEGATIVE(struct6_t, "{\"w\": {\"word\": [1, 2]}, \"b1\": {\"byte\": [1, 2, 3, 4]}}"); - see metac_s11n_json_ut_001.c

11. create function to read/write bit fields (arch independent). See STRUCT_TYPE_SMOKE_MEMBER_BIT_FIELD for more details - _HANDLE_BITFIELDS - make it separate
5. make some highlevel API to get global offset(including bif fields)/type/size e.g. of field in struct in union in array (with C-syntax)
10. minor - expand metac_type.h by metac_type_array.h metac_type_union.h metac_type_struct.h metac_type_enum.h metac_type_subprogram.h
20. Easy PoC serialization/de-serialization. e.g. to serialize function call params to json (based on the function arguments) and de-serialize them
21. What to do with pointers and cycles?
22. improve serialization by adding different types of data format: json, xml?, asn.1(what sub-types - depends on lib to use), xdr(rpc), xml-rpc/json-rpc????, rest?????
23. try to make serialization/deserialization possible to compile, like regexp can be compiled to improve performance
24. use libffi to construct calls based on serialized data (need to somehow include this into 20/22).

33. 2d array
34. DW_ATE_complex_float
35. typedef enum __attribute__((packed, aligned(16)))_enum_{
    _eZero = 0,
    _eOne,
    _eTen = 10,
    _eEleven,
    _eTwelve,
}enum_t;


36. it's possible to make a special macro to create extra param. It will require an additional scan in nm: metac_<type>_extra.
this can be used to pass some params instead of guessing them: discriminator name, mode how to work with flex arrays (with/without len field)
e.g.
#define METAC_TYPEEXTRA_NAME(name) METAC(typeextra, name)
#define METAC_TYPE_EXTRA(name) struct metac_typeextra METAC_TYPEEXTRA_NAME(name)

metac__typeextra_pchar_ = {
{key: TE_DISCRIMINATOR, value: (void*){...link discr and union}}. also allow or deny multiple fields in the same union.
{key: TE_FLEXARRAY, value: (void*){TE_FLEXARRAY_MODE_WITH_LEN_FIELD, len_field_name: ""}
};
modify metac.awk to add this field to the type if it was defined

37. use approach from metaresc to generate only 1 struct per type (integrate at and children into it)

26. make doxygen doc generation
